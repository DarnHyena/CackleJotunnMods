# Cackleheim
Frighten your enemies with a distant cackle at night.

## Installation (manual)


## Features

-Playable gnoll in the form of an elaborate set of armor

## Credits
 Thanks to Jules, Tekla, GoldenJude, Zarboz, and Balrond for all their help in piecing together the scripts! \o/


## Changelog

-Migration to Jotunn

-Base code set up

-Added additional colors to gnoll base script

-Armorsets added in now too

-All three bases now hide the body \o/

## Known issues

- A slight quirk when swapping between the gnoll base and normal armor makes the texture for said chest armor not appear.
  Re-equiping the armor will fix it.
